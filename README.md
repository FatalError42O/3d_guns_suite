# 3d-guns-suite
A collection of mods to work with 3dguns and add additional content.

This mod(pack) is far from finished, this is Pre-Alpha
You'll find that:

A: the code is messy and in many cases unfinished and unoptimized
B: there's missing features
C: there's remenants of removed features
D: there's not textures, or any guns excluding one used for testing.
E: no docs.

This is not a finished mod, and furthermore I expect that you respect that fact, and do not berate me about it.

Here's how to test-
guns.lua has the testing gun, it should have essentially the entire API (exlcuding what I could have missed)
It's name is "guns3d:m4a1"
it takes 50r and 30r mags,
the 30r mag can use both acacia and regular wood
it can do this at the samae time

for ammo, it's important creative is off.

Shift+e will switch fire modes
z will unload and load magazines.
the rest should be obvious.
putting a gun into current hotbar index will probably crash.
