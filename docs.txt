NOT FINISHED!

for your convenience the documentation is split into two maintain sections.
one part is for the basic and built-in use of the API
the other is the internal functions and workings of the mod.

The first section exists for users making weapons that simply use the built in options

The second section exists for advanced users seeking to create more advanced gameplay and weaponry
using built-in support.
