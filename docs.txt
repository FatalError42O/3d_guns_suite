Gun item metadata

The ammo table format

    {bullets={}, magazine="", loaded_bullet="", total_bullets=0}

    Magazine:
        this is the name of the magazine that the gun contains
        if the gun does not use magazines, it will simply remain blank

        example: "guns3d:STANAG"

    Loaded_bullet:
        the name of the current bullet in the chamber.
        This is used for magazines containing multiple bullets,
        on firing/reloading, this will be selected using weighted randoms:
        `guns3d.weighted_randoms(ammo_table.bullets)`

        example: "guns3d:556"

    Bullets:
        this is a table containing the names of bullets and the amount in the magazine/clip

        example: {["guns3d:556"]=15, ["guns3d:556AP"]=15}
